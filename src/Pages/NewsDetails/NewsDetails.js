              <p>
                <span>S</span>amsung has introduced a new artificial
                intelligence-based photo editing app designed to clean up your
                images with just one tap. Galaxy Enhance-X is built for Galaxy
                phones running Android 10 or later, which includes the Galaxy S9
                up to the S22 as well as several mid-range models in the Galaxy
                A-series, among others. It's available to download for free now.
              </p>
              <h4>What Is Samsung Galaxy Enhance-X?</h4>
              <p>
                Galaxy Enhance-X was actually launched in early July, as
                reported by SamMobile, yet has gone largely unnoticed by most
                users. You can download the app through the Galaxy Store in the
                US. It's rolling out in other countries as well, although at the
                time of writing was not available everywhere. If it isn't
                available where you are, you can try it out by sideloading the
                version available at APKMirror, as long as you have a compatible
                phone. APKMIrror is our top pick for safe places to download APK
                files.
              </p>
              <p>
                Enhance-X uses what's described as "AI-based techniques" to fix
                and clean up your images. It offers several basic photo editing
                tools, such as those for adjusting the brightness or applying
                HDR effects. But there are also a few things that you'd normally
                only expect to find in more pro-level editing apps like
                Lightroom. These include:
              </p>
              <li>
                Removing blur from your photos caused by camera shake or excess
                movement from the subject
              </li>
              <li>Lightening images shot in low light conditions</li>
              <li>
                Fixing moire, the unwanted pattern that can sometimes occur when
                shooting displays or certain types of fabric
              </li>
              <li>Removing reflections</li>
              <p>
                The app can also enlarge your photos by two or three timesâ€”this
                is one of the most common uses of AI in photo editing apps,
                although the results can sometimes vary wildly in quality. Not
                that that matters too much, as the app saves the edited photo as
                a copy, so you always have the original to fall back on if you
                aren't happy with the results. Samsung's Galaxy Enhance-X looks
                like another solid addition to the already impressive suite of
                camera and photo editing tools the company provides for its
                phones, tools that help it keep up with the likes of Apple and
                Google in the photography stakes. The phones have been able to
                shoot and edit RAW images for a while now, and have also picked
                up the clever new Object Eraser tool that cleanly removes
                unwanted objects or people from your photos.
